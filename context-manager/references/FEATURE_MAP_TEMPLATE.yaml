# FEATURE_MAP.yaml - Feature definitions for CMS
#
# Each feature defines a working set for parallel agents.
# Features enable scoped context loading - agents only read
# the feature bundle relevant to their task.
#
# Structure:
#   feature_name:
#     description: What this feature is
#     files: List of file paths/patterns owned by this feature
#     keywords: Terms that indicate work on this feature
#     depends_on: Other features this one requires
#
# Tips:
# - Keep features focused (3-10 files typical)
# - Use directory patterns for related files (src/api/)
# - Keywords help auto-detect which feature a task belongs to
# - Dependencies ensure agents load prerequisite context
